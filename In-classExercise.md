An operating system is just a very complicated program. It has the job of organizing other programs on a computer, including sharing the computer's time, memory, hardware and other resources. 

Since the operating system has to interact with the hardware on a computer system, it also has to have specific knowledge of the hardware on a system. To allow operating systems to be used on a variety of computers, the concept of drivers was invented. 

Drivers are small bits of code that can be added and removed from the operating system in order to allow the operating system to talk to a particular piece of hardware.

When the Ebola outbreak in West Africa picked up pace in July 2014, Caitlin Rivers started to collect data on the people affected. Rivers, then a PhD student in computational epidemiology, wanted to model the outbreak’s spread. So every day she downloaded PDF updates released by the ministries of health of the virus-stricken countries, and converted the numbers into computer-readable tables. 

Rather than keeping these files to herself, she posted them to GitHub.com, a hugely popular website for collaborative work on software code. Rivers thought the postings might attract those interested in up-to-date information from the Ebola outbreak. “I figured if I needed it, other people would, too,” she says.
